*Supporting all versions of django and python.*

  - automatic Dockerfile creation
  - automatic docker-compose.yaml creation
  - automatic deploy function and docker swarm deploy.yaml file which helps you deploy your newly created application using nginx, gunicorn and docker swarm.

# Features

  - NO-HEADACHE-DJANGO supports almost all of the popular databases including postgres and mysql.


It Also does:
  - Automatic creation of README.me, git, .gitignore and requirements.txt files if needed. 
  - Tools for easily managing your application during development.

### REQUIREMENTS

NO-HEADACHE-DJANGO is specially designed for ubuntu systems and needs python >= 3 to run, but remember you need to install your desired versin of python if you are willing to create a project using that version.


### Installation

You need to install docker, docker-compose, python3 and virtualenv in order to use NO-HEADACHE-DJANGO.

Install the dependencies:

```sh
$ apt update
$ apt install python3
$ apt install docker docker.io
$ apt install docker-compose
$ apt install virtualenv
```

### Using NO-HEADACHE-DJANGO
NO-HEADACHE-DJANGO works perfectly with projects that follow the standard project structure of django or projects that are created using NO-HEADACHE-DJANGO, although it supports dockerizing other projects but this is not reliable and may not work as expected.

Standard project structure for django is something like this:

├── project_folder
│   ├── manage.py
│   ├── project_name
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── settings.py
│   │   ├── urls.py
│   │   └── wsgi.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├────── app1 
├────── app2 
└────── app3 


*So the best way to have a fully dockerized django is using NO-HEADACHE-DJANGO while starting the project*

starting a project:
```sh
$ no-headache startproject <project_name> <project_root> <database> <python_versioin>
```
example:
```sh
$ no-headache startproject amazing_project . postgres 3.6
```
This will create a project named 'amazing_project' in your current directory using postgres database and python3.6

The result would be something like this:

├── amazing_project
│   ├── docker-compose.yaml
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── entrypoint.sh
│   ├── manage.py
│   ├── amazing_project
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── settings.py
│   │   ├── urls.py
│   │   └── wsgi.py
│   ├── README.rst
│   └── requirements.txt
└── venv

Dockerizing a project:
```sh
$ no-headache dockerize <project_root> <database> <python_version>
```
example:
```sh
$ no-headache dockerize ./an_old_project mysql 2.7
```
This will dockerize an existing project in a folder named an_old_project in your current directory which is written in python2.7 using mysql.
